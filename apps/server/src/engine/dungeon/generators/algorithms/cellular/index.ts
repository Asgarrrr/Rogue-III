/**
 * Modular cellular automaton dungeon generator
 *
 * This package provides a high-performance, extensible cellular automaton
 * generator with the following optimizations:
 *
 * - Grid operations using Uint8Array for better cache locality
 * - Union-Find for O(Î±(n)) connected component analysis
 * - Spatial hashing for O(1) average collision detection
 * - Scanline flood fill for efficient region detection
 * - Object pooling to reduce garbage collection pressure
 * - A* pathfinding with multiple heuristics and path smoothing
